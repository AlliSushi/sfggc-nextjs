            The San Francisco Golden Gate Classic (SFGGC) is a United States Bowling Congress (USBC) certified

            membership from both organizations. If membership is needed from either organization you may purchase a USBC
            membership for $25.00 (US) and an IGBO membership for $25.00 (US). Active card-carrying members of the PBA
            must state so on their entry form. Maximum of 1 PBA member allowed per team. IN THE BEST INTEREST OF

          <li>
            ENTERING AVERAGE: The tournament operates on the ideal of fair play. Should the Tournament Director(s)
            discover any evidence of violation of this ideal, a bowler may be disqualified at any time, at the
            discretion of the Tournament Director(s). Please, no cheating. All bowlers entering SFGGC mush show proof of
            having an established ten-pin average acceptable to USBC. Proof of average is defined as: 1) credible
            website with free access (i.e., bowl.com, leaguesecretary.com); 2) clear picture or scanned copy of your
            league sheet; 3) hard copy of a league sheet with name and average highlighted; 4) a signed paper with
            average from the League Secretary with their name and phone number. The following rules apply when
            submitting entering average. The
            <strong>
              highest
            </strong>
            of the following averages will be used:

                If a bowler has qualified for winnings of $600.00 or more in any tournament not including any side pots
                (such as brackets, mega brackets, etc.) in the previous 12 months, the actual scores and winnings from
                the tournament must be reported for possible re-rating. Re-rating must be done before the entrant bowls.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is the bowler’s responsibility to make sure SFGGC has their correct average based on the rules above
                regardless of who may have submitted the average for you. Submitting an incorrect average shall be cause
                for disqualification and forfeiture of entry fees and prize winnings.
              </li>
              <li>
                The average of any bowler may be adjusted at the discretion of the Tournament Director(s) and we reserve
                the right to utilize specialty tournaments and events (i.e., 5, 8 & 10 game tournaments, Vegas Pot
                Games, etc.) in adjusting a bowler's entering average.
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Any average adjustment must be made before the completion of the entrant's first game of
                    competition. Any bowler unwilling to accept the average change will receive a refund, cease bowling
                    and receive a zero score for all games if a qualified bowler cannot be found as a replacement. Team
                    members will NOT receive a refund.

        </h1>
        <ol className='rule_text'>
          <li>
            The Scratch Masters, in conjunction with the SFGGC, is an optional mixed competition open to all tournament
            entrants. The Scratch Masters has a separate entry fee and the amount is based on the division. Prize money
            for each division consists of the total entry fees received in that division.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tournament Director(s) may place a bowler into a higher division at their discretion. Any such adjustment
            will be made before the entrant bowls.
          </li>
          <li>
            The scratch scores from Team and Doubles events ONLY from the SFGGC will be used to determine the eight (8)
            qualifiers and one alternate in each division. Scores DO NOT carry over from the regular tournament. A tie
            for 8th position is broken by bowling one complete game prior to play to determine the qualifier.
          </li>
          <li>
            All scores bowled in Scratch Masters and all scores used to determine qualifiers are scratch (no handicap
            added at any time).
          </li>
          <li>
            All 8 qualifiers will get 10 minutes of practice on division assigned lanes.
          </li>
          <li>
            The top eight (8) qualifiers in each division will bowl 3 games each, 2 bowlers on one pair of lanes. After
            each game, bowlers will switch to a different set of lanes in their division (based on scratch masters lane
            schedule).
          </li>
          <li>
            The total scratch scores will be added after the first 3 games, then 4 bowlers will be dropped (ranked
            5th-8th for final standings) and 4 bowlers will advance. In the event there is a tie after the 3 games, a
            <strong>
              one ball
            </strong>
            roll-off will occur. If bowlers are still tied, they will continue to bowl one ball each until the tie is
            broken.
          </li>
          <li>
            The remaining 4 bowlers will bowl in a head to head, step-ladder fashion and all previous scores will be
            discarded. The 4th place bowler will bowl the 3rd place bowler. The winner will advance and bowl the 2nd
            place bowler and the winner of that game will bowl the 1st place qualifier for the championship. In each of
            the step-ladder games, the bowler seeded higher will get to choose to finish first or last.
          </li>
          <li>
            A lane schedule will be given to each division prior to the start of competition. No exceptions. The bowlers
            are responsible for checking if they have qualified.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bowlers must be physically present for check-in thirty (30) minutes prior to the scheduled start of the
            Scratch Masters competition. A bowler who does not check-in as specified will be immediately disqualified
            and replaced by the alternate. If the alternate is not present, the spot is filled by the next highest
            ranking bowler in the division present at the time of check-in.
          </li>
          <li>
            The match game competition will begin within one hour of the end of team event on Sunday, February 16, 2020.
            Each Division will bowl on a different set of eight (8) lanes. Bowlers must be physically present for
            check-in following the Team event, NO EXCEPTIONS.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any claims of error in the roll-off must be submitted before the start of the next match. Any claim of an
            error in the final match must be reported with one (1) hour of the completion of the final match.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Optional Scratch Masters payout will be 100% of the entry fees paid by participants by division. The
            award ratio for Scratch Masters by division shall be at a minimum of 1 in 2 entries, with a maximum of 6
            places paid in each division.
          </li>
          <li>
            If fewer than 8 bowlers in in any Division sign up for Scratch Masters, they will be given the option of
            having their fee refunded or moving up to the next higher division.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Scratch Masters divisions are defined as:
